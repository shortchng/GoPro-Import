# GoPro-Import
Import your GoPro files into a base directory with structure based on Creation Date, Rename Files to something more meaningful, and Delete files from SD card if desired

This is a Powershell Script to import GoPro files into a directory structure based on the Creation Date of the file and the Camera from which it came from. It will also rename the files based on a video_chapter structure instead of GoPro's non-sensical naming structue.
